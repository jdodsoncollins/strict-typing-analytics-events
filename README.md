## Type-safe analytics events

This is a simple project intended to demo typesafe analytics calls.

Note: Project is extending a basic React Vite "hello world" type webapp, but there is no UI beyond verifying that build was successful.

#### Installation
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev`
3. Visit [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/) to verify build
4. Head to `app.tsx` to start tinkering

VS Code or your IDE of choice (with typescript config support) should highlight typing errors while working, before compilation. If you would like to verify typing at compile time, run `npm run build`

If you run into issues, please let me know, and ensure you are running TypeScript 4.9.3 or newer.
